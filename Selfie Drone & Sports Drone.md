### **Selfie Drone & Sports Drone**

Our project is aiming on making two different kinds of drones. One is focusing on photo
taking, and flying stability. One is specifically designed for recording video during a sport
event like skiing and parkour, and will focus on flying flexibility.

**Societal Impact**

Selfie Drone aims to take stunning selfies and group shots from a unique perspective that is
impossible with handheld camera.

Sport Drone helps outdoor sports lovers to record their stunning sport moment without the
help of others holding a camera.
